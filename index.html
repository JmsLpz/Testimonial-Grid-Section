                        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                        were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                        honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                        the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                        weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since competing the course, I've
                        successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                        never written a line of code. I needed
                        some structures from professionals
                        who can help me learn programming
                        step by step. I was encouraged to
                        enroll by a former student of theirs
                        who can only say wonderful things
                        about the program. The entire
                        curriculum and staff did not
                        disappoint. They were very hands-on
                        and I never had to wait long for
                        assistance. The agile team project, in
                        particular, was outstanding. It took
                        my learning to the next level in a way
                        that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,
                        I've often referred to it during
                        interviews as an example of my
                        development experience. It certainly
                        helped me land to a job as a full-stack
                        developer after receiving multiple
                        offers. 100% recommended"
